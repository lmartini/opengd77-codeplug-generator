Prerequisites Installation on Windows 10
1. Install Python and pip
    1. Download Python: Go to the official Python website and download Python for Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
    2. Install Python:
        ? Open the Python installer you downloaded.
        ? Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" (this is important to ensure Python is accessible from the command line).
        ? Click "Install Now".
    3. Verify Python Installation:
        ? Open a Command Prompt and type the following to check Python and pip versions:

       python --version
       pip --version
If these commands return versions of Python and pip, the installation was successful.
2. Install Required Python Libraries
The Python program you provided uses several libraries: requests, pandas, selenium, and a few others from the Python Standard Library (csv, json). To install these libraries, run the following command:
    1. Open Command Prompt:
        ? Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter to open the command prompt.
    2. Install the required Python libraries:
       
       pip install requests pandas selenium
3. Install Google Chrome
The script uses Selenium to control Chrome, so you need to install Google Chrome on your Windows machine:
    1. Download Google Chrome:
        ? Go to Google Chrome download page.
        ? Download and install Google Chrome for Windows.
    2. Verify Chrome Installation:
        ? Open Chrome and type chrome://settings/help in the URL bar to verify the version of Chrome installed.
4. Install ChromeDriver
Selenium needs ChromeDriver to interface with Google Chrome. ChromeDriver version must match the version of Chrome you installed.
    1. Check Chrome Version:
        ? In Chrome, go to chrome://settings/help to find the version number of Chrome.
    2. Download ChromeDriver:
        ? Visit the ChromeDriver downloads page: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.
        ? Download the correct version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed Chrome version.
    3. Extract ChromeDriver:
        ? Extract the downloaded .zip file (usually containing chromedriver.exe).
        ? Move chromedriver.exe to a known location, such as C:\WebDriver.
    4. Add ChromeDriver to System Path: To make ChromeDriver available from the command line:
        ? Right-click This PC and choose Properties.
        ? Click Advanced System Settings on the left.
        ? Click the Environment Variables button.
        ? Under System Variables, scroll down to Path and click Edit.
        ? Click New, then add the path to the folder where you extracted chromedriver.exe (e.g., C:\WebDriver).
        ? Click OK on all windows to save.
    5. Verify ChromeDriver Installation: Open a new Command Prompt and type:
       
       chromedriver --version
You should see the ChromeDriver version displayed.
